                    <p>The Host is the person who organizes the meal and receives at home. After choosing the menu and determine the price of the groceries, he just needs to fill up a short form to see his meal published online.</p>
                    <p>The Help cooking are helper guests. They will arrive earlier in order to help the host to cook. The time of their arrival is specified in the meal description.</p>
                    <p>The Help cleaning are helper guests. They will help the host to clean the dishes and order.</p>
                    <p>The Simple guests are guests. They won’t help the host but they will pay a little bit more. This surplus will be shared between the host and the helpers, according to our calculations below. This extra role is particularly useful when
                        a host wants to organize a meal with quite a lot of participants but do not need so many helpers, or in the case that someone wants to come to a meal and is not very fond of cooking or cleaning.</p>
                    <p>The number of each role are determined by the host when he fills the form. Each participant has to decide his role when he subscribes to a meal.</p>

                    <h2 class="size-20 font-weight-normal">Price of the groceries</h2>

                    <p>The price of the groceries is determined by the host. We encourage him to be the more accurate possible.</p>
                    <p>This price is then shared between all the participants according to their role. At the end of the meal, each guest has to pay directly to the host who bought the groceries. THERE ARE NO WEBSITE FEES. Our service is completely free.</p>
                    <p>The price paid by each role is determined using the next calculations:
                        <ul>
                            <li>If everybody helps: everybody pays the same. Then, the price of the groceries is simply divided by the number of participants.</li>
                            <li>If there are “simple guests”: each of them pay 25% more and the surplus generated is redistributed at 50% to the host and at 50% to the others helpers. If the number of simple guests is that important that the price of the
                                meal for the host becomes negative, the host won’t pay and the additional surplus will be shared equitably between the helpers, reducing again the final price of their meal.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
