                <p>The price of the groceries is determined by the host. We encourage him to be the more accurate possible.</p>
                <p>This price is then shared between all the participants according to their role. At the end of the meal, each guest has to pay directly to the host who bought the groceries. THERE ARE NO WEBSITE FEES. Our service is completely free.</p>
                <p>The price paid by each role is determined using the next calculations:
                    <ul>
                        <li>If everybody helps: everybody pays the same. Then, the price of the groceries is simply divided by the number of participants.</li>
                        <li>If there are “simple guests”: each of them pay 25% more and the surplus generated is redistributed at 50% to the host and at 50% to the others helpers. If the number of simple guests is that important that the price of the meal
                            for the host becomes negative, the host won’t pay and the additional surplus will be shared equitably between the helpers, reducing again the final price of their meal.</li>
