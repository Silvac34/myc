        <h2 style="font-size:18px">You want to eat homemade food and meet new people?</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Whether you want to share your talents as a cook, learn new recipes or give a hand with washing the dishes and then share a good meal, myCommuneaty is there for you.</p>
        <p>It is a social network that connects lovers of good cooking and conviviality so that they organize meals in all simplicity.</p>
        <div class="clear10"></div>
        <h3 style="font-size:16px">** The idea is to share the meal together, but also the tasks and budget that goes with it **</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>How does it work?:</em></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 10px;">Any member of myCommuneaty can suggest organizing a meal at home. He then indicates his menu and the help he needs: helping cook or helping to wash the dishes.</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 10px;">Then other members of myCommuneaty sign up for the meal by selecting what help they want to bring.</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 10px;">MyCommuneaty takes care of transmitting all the necessary information and dividing the expenses according to the participation of each one (see detail of the calculation below).</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 10px;">All that is left to do is to prepare the meal and enjoy the moment.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>The status "Simple guest":</em></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 10px;">In the event that the host wishes to offer a meal with more guests and has enough people to help him, he may propose the "Simple guest" status which will come just to share the meal without helping for the preparation. In such a case, this "guest"
            pays a small fee which is redistributed between all the aids and the host.</p>
