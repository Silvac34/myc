She lived for 2 years in Chile where she studied engineering. She is the visible face of our team. So, if you are here,
                    it is probably because you or one of your friends have seen a post she wrote to promote myCommuneaty.</div>

I studied engineering and I am still learning about programming: that is why I am writing to you right now through my code
                    editor: damn so nerd this guy. Doesn't matter, I am already in a couple ... When you click on a button, I probably programmed it, so if something goes bad, you can blame me.</div>

He loves to do hiking in the moutain (that's what he did in New Zealand for few months) and to explore new horizons. He probably loves his girlfriend too but shuuuu,
                    she maybe doesn't know yet. He is an engineer and works on the website.</div>

    <h4><em>History</em></h4>
    <p style="padding-left: 10px;" class="text-justify">Everything started thanks to Dimitri’s desire for realizing an entrepreneurship related with food. This desire became an idea and then a project, with the involvement of Maylis and Kevin.</p>

    <p style="padding-left: 10px;" class="text-justify">In October 2015, we started SharEat in Chile and, realized more than 40 collaborative meals using Facebook and Google Apps
        as platforms. After a while, we decided to start creating a website. We realized than the domain name SharEat was already used, so we changed it for the current myCommuneaty.</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 10px; margin-top:25px" class="text-justify">In April 2017, we were happy to start using our first version of the website in Melbourne. We keep working hard in this project and we would be happy to receive your feedbacks, comments or ideas. So, please feel free to contact and join us !</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 10px;">Let’s start the Aussie experience for myCommuneaty !</p>
