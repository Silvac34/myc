I studied engineering and I am still learning about programming. When you click on a button, I probably programmed it, so if something goes wrong, you can blame me.</div>

    <h4><em>History</em></h4>
    <p style="padding-left: 10px;" class="text-justify">Everything started with Dimitriâ€™s desire for realizing an entrepreneurship related with food. This desire became an idea and then a project thanks to Maylis and Kevin.</p>

    <p style="padding-left: 10px;" class="text-justify">In October 2015, in Chile, we started the project named at this time SharEat. 40 collaborative meals were realized using Facebook and Google Apps
        as platforms. After a while, we decided to start creating a website. As the domain name SharEat was already used, we changed it for the current name myCommuneaty.</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 10px; margin-top:25px" class="text-justify">In April 2017, we were happy to present the first website version. We keep working hard on this project and would be happy to receive your feedbacks, comments or ideas. So, please feel free to contact and join us !</p>
