She lived for 2 years in Chile where she studied engineering. She is the visible face of our team. Indeed :compared to the rest of the team, she is the most beautiful (besides she is a girl)</div>

I studied engineering and I am still learning about programming: that is why I am writing to you right now through my code editor --> damn so nerd this guy / I am in a couple with maylis so it doesn't matter ...</div>

                <div class="text-justify">Kevin is an adventurer, that is why we call him kevo the adventurer. He loves to do hiking in the moutain (that's what he did in new zealand for few months) and to explore new horizons. He probably loves his girlfriend to but shuuuu, she maybe doesn't know yet. He is an engineer and works on the website. When you click on a button, he probably programmed it, so if something goes bad, you can blame him.</div>
