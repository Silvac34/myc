                    <li><strong class="text-primary">Don’t spam</strong>: We value human interaction and want the content on our site and sent to our members to be personalized and valuable. Copying and pasting the same message across the site, in member-to-member
                        messages, Groups, Local discussions or Event listings is not permitted. Messaging many members that have not shown an intent to receive the type of message your sending may also be considered spam. </li>
                    </br>
                    <li><strong class="text-primary">Don’t look for a date</strong>: Our members join myCommuneaty to create friendships. Don’t contact other members for dating, or use the site to find sexual partners. We take reports of unwanted sexual advances,
                        both online and offline, seriously and they may be considered violations of our Conduct policy. Respect others’ boundaries. If another member lets you know they are uncomfortable, respect their feelings and take a step back.
                    </li>
                    </br>
                    <li><strong class="text-primary">Don’t intimidate, stalk, or harass</strong>: Stalking, intimidation, threats, and harassment of other members is prohibited. Harassment is defined as a pattern of offensive behavior that appears to have
                        the purpose of adversely affecting a targeted person or persons. Examples of harassment include making threats, repeated unwanted contacts with a person, and posting the personal information of another person. myCommuneaty reserves
                        the right to take action (see above) on profiles we believe may pose a threat to community.</li>
                    </br>
                    <li><strong class="text-primary">Do create only one profile</strong>: Duplicate, fake, and joke profiles are not allowed. The first profile that you create must be you and is the only one that you may have. Our trust network needs everyone
                        to stand by their reputation.</li>
                    </br>
                    <li><strong class="text-primary">Be yourself</strong>: Misrepresenting yourself as someone else is prohibited. This includes representation as an agent, representative, or affiliate of myCommuneaty.</li>

                        includes behavior that causes excessive reports, flags, or blocks from other members. We may prohibit proactive outreach on communications that are flagged by myCommuneaty members or that we believe harm the experience for other
                        members. Additionally, posting anything to the site that includes viruses, corrupted data, or other potentially harmful code. Attempting to circumvent myCommuneaty systems, or using these systems in a manner which undermines their

                    <li><strong class="text-primary">Don’t force your beliefs and lifestyle choices on others</strong>: myCommuneaty is proud of the diversity of its members. Using our platform to recruit other members to join your lifestyle or belief system
                        may be a violation of our Conduct policy. Don’t make the adoption of your lifestyle or belief system a condition of your meal offer. While certain house rules are expected, if we believe that the conditions imposed on the members
                        introduce risk, harms the experience of our members, or damages the reputation of myCommuneaty, we reserve the right to prohibit the requirement.</ol>

                    generally interfere with reference content left by members. In extremely rare circumstances, myCommuneaty may censor, temporarily hide, or remove reference content if it violates our Reference Guidelines.
