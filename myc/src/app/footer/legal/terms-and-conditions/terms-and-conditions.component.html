            <h4 class="text-primary">ELIGIBILITY, REGISTRATION AND ACCOUNT</h4>
            <p>
                2.1 You must be at least 18 years old to access or use the Services. By registering to use our Services, you represent that you are at least 18 years old. In order to access certain areas and features of our Services, you will need to register for an account
                using your login credentials from Facebook. By registering for an account, you further agree to (a) provide accurate, truthful, current and complete information; (b) maintain and promptly update your account information upon any changes;
                (c) maintain the security of your account by protecting your password and restricting access to your account; (d) promptly notify myCommuneaty if you discover or otherwise suspect any security breaches related to the Services; and (e)
                take responsibility for all activities that occur under your account and accept all risks of any authorized or unauthorized access.</p>
            <br />
            <h4 class="text-primary">INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER MEMBERS</h4>
            <p>
                3.1 You Have Sole Responsibility When Interacting with Other Members. Our Services provide a platform for members to learn about one another, arrange meals and help, engage in activities and communicate with one another. myCommuneaty is not a party to,
                has no involvement or interest in, makes no representations or warranties as to, and has no responsibility or liability with respect to any communications, transactions, interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and
                any other member, person or organization. You are solely responsible for your interactions with other members of our Services. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor interactions between you and other members of our Services.
            </p>
            <p>Remember, the myCommuneaty Services are just a platform that enable you to communicate and interact with other people around the world. We cannot be responsible for the interactions that you have with other members, so please use good judgment
                and keep safety in mind when you use our Services.</p>
            <p>3.2 Identity Verification. We cannot and do not confirm each member’s identity. Although we provide tools intended to assist with identity verification, such as our address verification tool (as described in Section 3.3), You are solely responsible
                for determining the identity and suitability of others with whom you may interact through our Services. myCommuneaty does not represent or warrant that our tools are sufficient to determine whether it is appropriate for you to interact
                with another member. Further, we do not endorse any persons who use or register for our Services. We do not investigate or verify any member’s reputation, conduct, morality, criminal background, or any information members may submit to
                the Services. We encourage you to take precautions when interacting with other members, particularly when meeting a stranger in person for the first time.</p>
            <p>3.3 Our Address-Verification Tool. Our address verification tool (through Google map services) is intended merely to confirm that the postal address a member submits to us is an address at which that member is able to access or receive mail.
                myCommuneaty’s address verification tool is not intended to confirm that a member actually resides at a particular address. While this is one of many ways to reduce the risk of misconduct by a member, it is not a guarantee of any member’s
                identity or good faith.</p>
            <p>3.4 Member-Hosted Events; myCommuneaty Ambassadors. Members may organize in-person meetings and host events for other myCommuneaty members; however, these events are not sponsored or endorsed by myCommuneaty and members attend such meetings
                and events at their own risk. In addition, myCommuneaty members may sign up to become myCommuneaty Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) and contribute their time to activities that support the myCommuneaty community, such as
                meeting new members, organizing events and answering questions. myCommuneaty Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) are not agents of myCommuneaty and myCommuneaty is not responsible or liable for any acts or omissions of these
                members.
            </p>
            <p>3.5 Release. Because our Services are merely a platform, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more members, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law you release myCommuneaty from claims, demands and damages (actual and
                consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.</p>
            <br />

                notify of us such content by <a routerLink="/footer_more_contact"><u>contacting us</u></a>. Enforcement of these Terms, however, is solely in our discretion and the absence of enforcement in some instances does not waive of our right to enforce the Terms in other instances. In addition,
                these Terms do not create a private right of action on the part of any third party or any reasonable expectation that the Services will not contain any content that is prohibited by such rules.</p>
            <p>4.2 Member Conduct. By accessing or using the Services, you agree to act responsibly, exercise good judgment and comply with the myCommunity <a routerLink="/footer_legal_guidelines"><u>Guidelines</u></a>. In addition, you agree not to:</p>
